Now, for the martial art’s section! Luke was a notable Form 5 practitioner also known as Djem So/Shien So but was known to open up in a form 4 Ataru stance most likely to off balance opponents with the element of surprise. Following his father’s footsteps, he focused much on this particular form but there have been traces of all other known forms from 1-6. Just as Vader did he learnt from his mistakes on Mustafar and completely retooled his fighting style to protecting his weak points in his cybernetic suit. Luke was extremely skilled in lightsaber combat, as demonstrated when coupled with the force he was able to slice and dice through hoards of elite Yuzhaan Vong warriors left and right. Even Jaina and Jacen couldn’t follow him all the way with their already enhanced and near top tier force senses! The fact that Luke had such minimal training with Yoda and Obi-Wan and that he was able to defeat Vader who may have been holding back. But nonetheless was still extremely a skilled duelist even surprised Lord Sidious! Who was noted for his skill’s in the blade and the force! Luke eventually constructed a second lightsaber Shoto with a red crystal to combat Lumiya’s lightwhip which he at first had difficulty handling due to his single saber which didn’t have as much reach and leverage as a lightwhip. Seeing as how he constructed a second lightsaber, he must’ve had some training in duel blade fencing. This could most likely be a result of him having much diversity in his fighting style. At one point during Luke’s exile, he was attacked The Lost Tribe of The Sith and himself and Ben had to fight through at least 15 fully trained Sith and were skilled in their own right.

Yoda, is a known and well rounded master of all forms, ranging from form 1-7! But due to his stature,age and disabilities is limited to Form 4 also known as Ataru and is based on using the whole body as an extension and a weapon. Taking this form to it’s nth degree, was a fast,small and always on the move target making Yoda a small but deadly target and warrior. But he is most known for his power in the force, being able to levitate many battledroids and hover them in the path of droid Tri-fighters and using the force to push infantry and tanks back into their carriers and collide them into each other taking out entire battalions in the process.
